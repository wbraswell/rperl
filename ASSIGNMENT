COPYRIGHT ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT

For good and valuable consideration, receipt of which I acknowledge, I, an individual named _________________________________________________, hereby transfer to William N. Braswell, Jr. (hereinafter "Braswell") my entire right, title, and interest (including all rights under copyright) worldwide in my changes and enhancements to the RPerl software or documentation, subject to the conditions below.  These changes and enhancements are herein called the "Work."  The Work hereby assigned shall also include any future versions of these or any other changes and enhancements hereafter made by me.

I hereby agree that if I have or acquire hereafter any patent or interface copyright or other intellectual property interest dominating the software enhanced by the Work (or use of that software), such dominating interest shall not be used to undermine the effect of this assignment, i.e. Braswell and all subsequent licensees shall be licensed to use, in that software and its derivative works, without royalty or limitation, the subject matter of the dominating interest.  This license provision shall be binding on my heirs, assignees, or other successors to the dominating interest, as well as on me.

I hereby represent and warrant that I am the sole copyright holder for the Work and that I have the right and power to enter into this contract.  I hereby indemnify and hold harmless Braswell, his heirs, assignees, or other successors and the officers, employees, and agents of any organization controlled or owned in majority by Braswell, against any and all claims, actions or damages (including attorney's reasonable fees) asserted by or paid to any party on account of a breach or alleged breach of the foregoing warranty.  I make no other express or implied warranty (including without limitation, in this disclaimer of warranty, any warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE).
