[[[ REGULAR EXPRESSIONS ]]]
From http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html

/m
Treat string as multiple lines. That is, change "^" and "$" from matching the start of the string's first line and the end of its last line to matching the start and end of each line within the string.

/s
Treat string as single line. That is, change "." to match any character whatsoever, even a newline, which normally it would not match.

Used together, as /ms, they let the "." match any character whatsoever, while still allowing "^" and "$" to match, respectively, just after and just before newlines within the string.

/x
/x tells the regular expression parser to ignore most whitespace that is neither backslashed nor within a bracketed character class. You can use this to break up your regular expression into (slightly) more readable parts. Also, the # character is treated as a metacharacter introducing a comment that runs up to the pattern's closing delimiter, or to the end of the current line if the pattern extends onto the next line. Hence, this is very much like an ordinary Perl code comment. (You can include the closing delimiter within the comment only if you precede it with a backslash, so be careful!)
Use of /x means that if you want real whitespace or # characters in the pattern (outside a bracketed character class, which is unaffected by /x), then you'll either have to escape them (using backslashes or \Q...\E ) or encode them using octal, hex, or \N{} escapes. It is ineffective to try to continue a comment onto the next line by escaping the \n with a backslash or \Q .
